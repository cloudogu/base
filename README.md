# Base Dogu Docker image

## How to Build

    make build


NOTE: _alpine linux version_ see FROM statement in Dockerfile

NOTE: _alpine linux version_ and _cloudogu revision_ should be mentioned on the first line in Dockerfile

More detailed instructions about building the base image can be found in [container_building.en.md](docs/container_building_en.md). 

## Why is there a branch called alpine3.5?

Some Dogus need Alpine 3.5 as their base, therefore, a base Dogu version with Alpine 3.5 must be maintained as well as one with a more recent Alpine.

## Additional packages for base not included in alpine repository

### doguctl

origin is https://github.com/cloudogu/doguctl/releases/download/v0.3.0/doguctl-0.3.0.tar.gz
cached in packages directory to avoid download

## What is the Cloudogu EcoSystem?
The Cloudogu EcoSystem is an open platform, which lets you choose how and where your team creates great software. Each service or tool is delivered as a Dogu, a Docker container. Each Dogu can easily be integrated in your environment just by pulling it from our registry.

We have a growing number of ready-to-use Dogus, e.g. SCM-Manager, Jenkins, Nexus Repository, SonarQube, Redmine and many more. Every Dogu can be tailored to your specific needs. Take advantage of a central authentication service, a dynamic navigation, that lets you easily switch between the web UIs and a smart configuration magic, which automatically detects and responds to dependencies between Dogus.

The Cloudogu EcoSystem is open source and it runs either on-premises or in the cloud. The Cloudogu EcoSystem is developed by Cloudogu GmbH under [AGPL-3.0-only](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-only.html).
